-- Reporting Challenge
-- Write a single SQL script that combines all of the previous questions into a scheduled report that the Balanced Tree team can run at the beginning of each month to calculate the previous month’s values.

-- Imagine that the Chief Financial Officer (which is also Danny) has asked for all of these questions at the end of every month.

-- He first wants you to generate the data for January only - but then he also wants you to demonstrate that you can easily run the samne analysis for February without many changes (if at all).

-- Feel free to split up your final outputs into as many tables as you need - but be sure to explicitly reference which table outputs relate to which question for full marks :)
